## To create a backup of a folder by compressing all its contents  into a ZIP file.

Step-by-Step Algorithm
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Accept the path of the folder to be backed up (input folder path)

Step 3: Check if the input folder exists
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ If not, display an error message and terminate
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ If yes, continue

Step 4: Generate a unique ZIP file name using the current date and time
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Format: "backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip"

Step 5: Create a new ZIP file with the generated name

Step 6: For each file in the folder and its subfolders:
â€ƒâ€ƒa. Get the full file path
â€ƒâ€ƒb. Compute the relative path (relative to the input folder)
â€ƒâ€ƒc. Add the file to the ZIP archive using the relative path

Step 7: Finalize and close the ZIP file

Step 8: Display a success message with the path of the created ZIP file

Step 9: End

# Backup of folder into a zip file

# Copies the whole contents of any folder into a zip file whose filename increaments

# File format should be like this filename_number.zip (number should be increamented)
