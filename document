# Chapter 1: Introduction

In the modern era of digital data, where individuals and organizations deal with large volumes of information daily, the need for robust backup solutions is paramount. Data loss can occur due to numerous reasons such as accidental deletion, system crashes, malware attacks, or hardware failures. To mitigate the risks associated with data loss, it is essential to create reliable backup mechanisms.

The "Backup to ZIP" project is a simple yet effective utility that allows users to back up their data by compressing files and folders into a ZIP archive. This utility ensures that users can store their data efficiently while minimizing storage space and maintaining accessibility. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the motivation behind it, design considerations, implementation details, and potential enhancements.

Chapter 2: Objective

The primary objective of the "Backup to ZIP" project is to develop a lightweight and user-friendly application that enables users to:

Select files and directories to be backed up.

Compress the selected data into a ZIP archive.

Ensure the integrity and accessibility of the backup files.

Provide options for naming and storing the backup archives.

This utility is designed for users who need a straightforward solution for periodic or one-time backups, without the complexity of enterprise-grade tools.

Chapter 3: Motivation

Data is an invaluable asset. From personal photographs and videos to professional documents and source code, data plays a crucial role in our lives. The increasing reliance on digital devices means that any data loss could result in inconvenience, financial loss, or even legal issues.

Conventional backup methods may require advanced configurations or expensive software licenses. The "Backup to ZIP" project addresses this gap by offering a basic, open-source solution that is platform-independent, easy to use, and efficient.

Chapter 4: Features

The following are the core features of the "Backup to ZIP" utility:

Selective Backup: Users can choose specific files or directories.
